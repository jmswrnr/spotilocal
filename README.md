# Spotilocal

A simple desktop app that saves your current Spotify track name and cover art to local files! â€” Inspired by [Snip](https://github.com/dlrudie/Snip), but much faster.

- âš¡ Instant updates of track information.
- ðŸ’» Runs in the background; find it in the system tray.
- ðŸªŸ Built-in Web Widget for easy use in OBS Studio browser source.
- ðŸŒ‰ WebSocket API to integrate real-time updates with custom projects, [example](src/renderer/web-widget/src/useReadApplicationState.tsx).
- ðŸ“œ Opt-in to save a history of all the tracks you listen to.
- ðŸ”— Listen on any other device; does not require Spotify locally.

## Why?

So you can get real-time updates of your Spotify state to integrate into your projects or productions.

#### Examples:

- OBS Studio browser source for livestream overlays.
- Bespoke presentation on custom displays like a [custom LED screen](https://jmswrnr.com/blog/streaming-a-canvas-to-leds).
- Keep a local record of all your listening history as requested [here](https://github.com/jmswrnr/spotilocal/issues/2).

## Settings

- **Empty content files when paused** - Update cover art to transparent image, and empty text file contents when you pause Spotify.
- **Small / Medium / Large cover art image** - Specify which resolutions of the cover art image you want to save.
- **Save JSON file** - Save player state to JSON file.
- **Save track history** - Saves a history of tracks you listen to in JSON, CSV, and text file.

> [!NOTE]  
> The JSON state and track history files will never be emptied on pause.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Deleting the track history JSON file will result in data loss. It will also delete the CSV and text file contents.

#### Web Widget
- **Enable web widget** - Activates the Web Widget and WebSocket API.
- **Port number** - Network port to use for the Web Widget (automatically chosen if empty).
- **Copy URL** - Copy the URL for the Web Widget.

> [!NOTE]  
> When adding to OBS as a Browser Source, set the height to 288 and  width to 2000+. Scale down in the scene to preference.

# Development

## How it technically works

It loads the Spotify web player in a hidden window to detect track changes and saves them to text files. 

It doesn't need to send a single API request on top of the default player!
